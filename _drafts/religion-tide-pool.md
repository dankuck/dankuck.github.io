Religion is a hard word to define. Depending on the context, an adherent will attempt to include others or leave them out. This leads to odd circumstances such as Christians claiming to be a persecuted minority in the United States while also claiming that the United States is a Christian nation.

This is actually an OK state to be in. Because words work differently in different contexts.

The right response when someone says "How do you define Whatever?" is: For what purpose?

It's been said that there are as many Christian religions as there are Christians. For most purposes, that's using too broad of a definition.

The other extreme is similarly problematic, where everyone who wants to be called Christian gets to be one.

Disclaimer: I am not a Christian.

I'd like to give one definition that I think is too important to ignore. It's not the final definition, because there is none.

A religion is like a tide pool.

A tide pool is a pool of water left near a shore when the ocean tide goes out. In rocky areas these tide pools always have water but the amount and type of water is frequently changing.

To survive in such a tide pool takes a lot of adaptability.

Other tide pools are hardly ever touched by the ocean. Survival in those is much calmer, but it's still not permanently separate from the ocean.

And it's really only easy to define the lines around tide pools when the tide is out.

Whenever the ocean comes in it brings with it all sorts of new organisms. If the ocean never came in, the tide pool's organisms would diverge from the rest of their species in the ocean. Wherever the ocean is constantly coming in, the organisms are unlikely to diverge far from the rest of the species in the ocean. They could form subspecies that are better adapted to tide pools, but they'd still be the same species for the purposes of, for example, breeding.

And where the ocean hardly ever comes in, the diversity gets very interesting.

Maybe you've been following the analogy all along. Religions are tide pools.

As the ocean brings new or reinvigorated genes to a tide pool, a similar process brings new ideas to religions.

As much as some religions would like to set themselves apart and be above the world, they cannot completely resist the influx of new ideas.

And most religions welcome that influx. They don't welcome all the new ideas, but they love to pull in the latest trends and repurpose them for Jesus.

At the same time, they don't always do it on purpose. The idea of God as a pudgy white guy with a ZZ Top beard is easy to dismiss but hard to shake. It sticks with us. The same is true for the cartoonish devil that kind of looks like he's just a guy in a devil costume. Along with many other depictions of the devil.

Now might be the time to mention that I have always thought of Biblical scenes and especially Jesus as cartoons from the Superbook TV show.Maybe you never saw it, but that piece of culture reached me just fine.

Whenever the ocean tide is out, every Sunday and maybe Wednesdays when churches get together and attempt to build up each member's faith, the church looks inward and evolves on its own. It might evolve based on the ideas of the members or it might be more structured and incorporate the ideas of an overarching organization of churches.

Religion is a hard word to define. Depending on the context, an adherent will attempt to include others or leave them out. This leads to odd circumstances such as Christians claiming to be a persecuted minority in the United States while also claiming that the United States is a Christian nation.

This is actually an OK state to be in. Because words work differently in different contexts.

The right response when someone says "How do you define Whatever?" is: For what purpose?

It's been said that there are as many Christian religions as there are Christians. For most purposes, that's using too broad of a definition.

The other extreme is similarly problematic, where everyone who wants to be called Christian gets to be one.

Disclaimer: I am not a Christian.

I'd like to give one definition that I think is too important to ignore. It's not the final definition, because there is none.

A religion is like a tide pool.

A tide pool is a pool of water left near a shore when the ocean tide goes out. In rocky areas these tide pools always have water but the amount and type of water is frequently changing.

To survive in such a tide pool takes a lot of adaptability.

Other tide pools are hardly ever touched by the ocean. Survival in those is much calmer, but it's still not permanently separate from the ocean.

And it's really only easy to define the lines around tide pools when the tide is out.

Whenever the ocean comes in it brings with it all sorts of new organisms. If the ocean never came in, the tide pool's organisms would diverge from the rest of their species in the ocean. Wherever the ocean is constantly coming in, the organisms are unlikely to diverge far from the rest of the species in the ocean. They could form subspecies that are better adapted to tide pools, but they'd still be the same species for the purposes of, for example, breeding.

And where the ocean hardly ever comes in, the diversity gets very interesting.

Maybe you've been following the analogy all along. Religions are tide pools.

As the ocean brings new or reinvigorated genes to a tide pool, a similar process brings new ideas to religions.

As much as some religions would like to set themselves apart and be above the world, they cannot completely resist the influx of new ideas.

And most religions welcome that influx. They don't welcome all the new ideas, but they love to pull in the latest trends and repurpose them for Jesus.

At the same time, they don't always do it on purpose. The idea of God as a pudgy white guy with a ZZ Top beard is easy to dismiss but hard to shake. It sticks with us. The same is true for the cartoonish devil that kind of looks like he's just a guy in a devil costume. Along with many other depictions of the devil.

Now might be the time to mention that I have always thought of Biblical scenes, and especially Jesus, as cartoons from the Superbook TV show. Maybe you never saw it, but that piece of culture reached me and stuck. Despite my knowing full well that the Bible was supposed to be real and cartoons are not real, that's the image I conjured.

Whenever the ocean tide is out and the tide pool is isolated, every Sunday and maybe Wednesdays when churches get together and attempt to build up each member's faith, the church looks inward and evolves on its own. It might evolve based on the ideas of the members or it might be more structured and incorporate the ideas of an overarching organization of churches.

When the ocean tide comes in, the tide pool is gone. And all the new organisms move in. Case in point, Christianity was a fusion of Helenistic ideas entering ancient Judaism. Suddenly Hell was a thing to think about when before it never was.

A few hundred years ago, the Rapture entered some tide pools of Christianity. The flow of ideas from one tide pool to another is slow and there's resistance. But Christians all over know about the Rapture idea even if their church doesn't buy it.

Without going too long, let me tie it all together.

Once a new idea gets a foothold in one faith tradition, it will travel to others. Separating one religion from another is about finding the barriers to that free flow of ideas. The fewer barriers there are the more it's possible to say that two groups are in the same religion.

Just a few decades ago, Baptists and Catholics found it impossible to get along together. They avoided each other and that limited the free flow of information.

Now they have much less problem. Each one still finds the other weird, but it's much easier now for a Baptist to take an idea from a Catholic coworker, for example, as long as the idea doesn't obviously clash with some Baptist idea.

A Catholic or Baptist in the United States would have a much harder time accepting ideas from a Muslim. So Catholics and Baptists are more of the same religion than either one is with Muslims. Their tide pools are more likely to mix and the organisms that cross over are more likely to survive.

Once one Baptist gets an idea from a Catholic or Muslim, they take that idea back to their church's potluck and mention it to the next guy. And it has a chance to thrive.

Some tide pools are just too distant to affect each other much. Taoism and Baptist Christianity are mostly practiced on opposite sides of the world. And there is little cause for them to interact via the Internet.

title: That Time I Didn't Change the World
---

Creating a social network is hard. If you look at the history of the strong ones, you'll notice something. They were social before they were big.

I didn't look at the history of them. I still haven't really and that was one mistake. But it wasn't my major mistake. My major mistake was 
when I failed to focus on people.

I was one in a line of people who tried to revolutionize social networks and turn Facebook on its head by creating a distributed social network.

Here "distributed" means that many different websites could be a part of the same network. The holy grail would be that people on MySpace
could friend people on Facebook (yes, MySpace, the idea is that old and older even).

In principle, this should have been simple. This is what email does, and it's one factor that makes it such a big deal. It's also one
of the things that make it a complete mess.

Any given action in Facebook triggers a lot of communications between the parts of the system representing users. Any distributed social network 
solution has to do a good job of addressing the network concerns that exist today. My plan was to ignore that until version 2.0. Or at least 
version 1.5.

"My Plan" is where things truly went wrong. I'm pretty smart, give or take, but for a thing like this to work, it needs people to be invested in it
from the start. Smart people who can work as a team. Which is why it's unlikely to happen.

There are several ways it could work:

<ol>
  <li>A strong, existing group puts a lot of work and branding behind it. Probably money, too.</li>
  <li>An existing social network opens up an API for accepting friends from other networks.</li>
  <li>A system like email grows to include social networking components.</li>
</ol>

But so far I've skipped the important question: Do we need this?

Do we need another social network? Do we need to distribute our social networks?

I used to think I knew. I'm not sure anymore. But that's for a different post.

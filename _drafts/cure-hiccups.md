title: "Cure Hiccups by Drinking Water Upside-Down and Backwards"
---

The backwards part is the key I missed before.

I get hiccups about as often as any one else, I suppose, but when I do, they last for hours. Occasionally they have lasted for days.

Did you know there's an injection for hiccups? I got it once. It lasted about 24 hours. Then I was on my own again.

I have occasionally had success stopping hiccups by drinking water upside-down. But my mistake was to lean forward to do it.

My father-in-law said something about stretching out your insides, so I tried adding that to my upside-down-water trick.

Do this:

# Get a glass of water. 
# Set it next to your bed on the floor. 
# Lay on the bed with your torso hanging off backwards. 
# Drink that water. 
# Don't drown.

When you have drunk the water your hiccups should be gone. Maybe stay put for a little while. Maybe get someone to spot you too, if you're not good at being upside-down.

This lasted me for several hours at a time. If you're not the kind of person who gets hiccups for days, then I'll bet it'll be a permanent solution.

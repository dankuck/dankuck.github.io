Board games seem like a good way to teach my kid some skills and have some fun myself. She's 3 1/2 and really good with numbers, so I figured it was time.

So we drove over to <a href="http://emeraldcitycomics.com" target="_blank">Emerald City</a> comics because they've got a more interesting selection of board games than a Target. More interesting to me anyway.

As it turns out, there is very little produced specifically for a four-year-old (the age I target for games, because she's smarter than your kid). But someone there helped us out and we came home with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00E3S8L7O?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creativeASIN=B00E3S8L7O&linkCode=xm2&tag=dankuck-20">Roll For It</a> a simple dice and card game.

Actually the day before, we'd found some dice in the closet and she liked them, so I had a hint this would work out.

## The Game

The rules are pretty simple:

1. Layout three cards from the deck. Each card has some die faces shown on it.
2. Each player gets one color dice.
3. On a players turn, they roll whatever dice they still have and match the results to one of the cards.
4. You win a card when you've placed one dice by it for each of the dice it has shown in its picture.

So we started playing and Alba had won a card within a minute or two. Great way to start. And eventually she got mad for whatever reason kids get mad and the game was over.

Yeah, so far, we haven't finished a game. Which is the other lesson opportunity you didn't realize you'd have.

Three-and-a-half-year-old kids lack the following skills which are prerequisites for any board/card/dice game:

1. Patience
2. Proper reverence for game rules
3. Medium-term objectives

All good things to learn. The point of your first game will be to teach "games" to the kid.

I think I picked well, because Alba has all the math and matching skills required for this game.

We're improving Alba's game skills with each game. We've played four or five games so far.

So here's how I'm tackling the three points above:

## Patience

Mainly I'm trying to keep the game going fast. I've found that having all four players slows things down. Especially at a party when everybody wants to talk about other stuff. People will not help you unless you explain to them what you're doing here.

So if I can keep to two players, that's better.

In addition, for this particular game, at any given time there will be more dice pictured on the cards than you can actually place. This is to introduce strategy. You have to choose which card to place dice on and try to win it.

That's a no go for speed and a no go for 3 1/2 year olds in general.

So now we just play with the blue and yellow cards. They have two and three dice, respectively, so you're highly unlikely to get stuck. Plus, I cheat and look at the cards before I place them on the table.

## Proper reverence for game rules

This is one where you yourself are liable to get upset.

Don't.

Just keep repeating "Games are more fun when everyone follows the rules."

When I told Alba that, she remembered that they also talk about that in preschool. So we had a nice conversation.

Still, she steals the cards I win.

## Medium-term objectives

The short-term objectives of this game are obvious. Place a die, get a card.

We have only recently even mentioned the medium-term objective: Win the game.

To do this, Alba has decided you need to get six cards.

Officially, each card has a number on it and those are supposed to add up to 40. But whatever, house rules.

I'm not sure how this part is going yet.

## Recommendation

If your kid is good at math and matching, this is a perfect game. The dice are small, don't let them swallow them.

We've also tried "Sorry", which was good, and I'm gonna try all the games I've tagged on this Pinterest board.

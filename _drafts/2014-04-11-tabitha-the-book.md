(I thought this one was boring and forgot it, but my kid actually requested it so I had to think it up again.)

One time at school, Tabitha was reading a book.

Remember, Tabitha never washes her hair.

So little black spots dropped out of her hair onto the book as she read. She couldn't read the book and she had to let another kid read it instead.

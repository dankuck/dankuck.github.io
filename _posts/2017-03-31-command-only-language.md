When I was a high school computer science teacher, students often asked me how you would translate certain English phrases to Java, the computer language we worked with.

Computer languages are concieved of as actual languages, not just magic spells you chant over a keyboard. So there should be translations for anything we want to say from English to a computer language. But it's a little tricky.

The difficulty arrises because computers only understand commands. In spoken languages, this is called the imperative tense, such as "Hey you, load those boxes onto those trucks."

But if you want to say something like "There are too many boxes to load onto this truck," the way to express that is not obvious. Mainly because it's not clear to the computer what you expect it to do with that information.

Whatever you want to say in a command-only language, such as a computer language, must make clear your expectations.

Here are some translations from normal English into command-only English. They all start with "Hey you" because otherwise the imperative tense is sometimes unclear in English, and because it's funnier.

```
English: I need a drink of water.

COE: Hey you, bring me a glass of water.
```

```
English: I can't hear you.

COE: Hey you, speak louder.
```

```
English: Hello!

COE: Hey you, respond to me (so I know you are listening).
```

```
English: There are too many boxes to load onto this truck.

COE: Hey you, get another truck for these boxes.
```

```
English: Karen finished the TPS reports.

COE: Hey you, remember that the TPS reports are finished. Hey you, remember that Karen was the one who finished them.
```

```
English: I'm done with all my work, what should I do now?

COE: Hey you, issue me a new task.
```

In all of the normal English versions, there is an implication about what you should do with the information. Command-only English makes that implication explicit.

Command-only English is a stripped down version of normal English. And so it's simpler than normal English. Imagine if instead of saying "How are you?" to your coworkers every morning, you would instead say "Hey you, acknowledge my presense." It loses some of the charm, but it removes the ambiguity over whether you actually want to know their state. 

If you want to know how they're doing, you'll command them "Hey you, tell me your current state". Then they'll command you to know that they are dreading the oblivion toward which we are all marching. They might then command you to bring them coffee while you're getting yourself some.

All in all, I prefer the charm of normal English. But for practical matters, like computers, it's nice to have a simplified alternative.

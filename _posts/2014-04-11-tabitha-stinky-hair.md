title: Tabitha's Stinky Hair
---
(I'm not proud of this one, but I think I swung it in a good direction.)

One time, Tabitha met some other kids and they had a lot of fun. They played on the swings and on the see-saw.

Remember, Tabitha never washes her hair.

When the kids came near her to play tag they said "What's that smell, ew." It was Tabitha's dirty dirty hair.

So Tabitha and the kids went and played a different game where they wouldn't get close and smell Tabitha's hair.

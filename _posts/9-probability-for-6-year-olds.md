Teaching homeschool

Taught a 2x50% rocket launch scenario to 9-yo.

Used graph paper.

Had her teach it to 6-yo.

He had some setbacks: wanting to make straighter lines, not handling his frustration well.

Once he had his lines drawn well, he handled the rest pretty well.

This tested that older kid understood it.

The younger kid understood it!

We counted the 75 squares together to make 75%.

He knows 10x10 is 100, so he knew there were 100 squares, without counting.

He took some coaching to understand the various sections.

Of course, he probably can't do it again from scratch.

I'm going to do it again, using the Sliders TV show ask examples, to enhance the concept that different possibilities may be treated as different worlds.

Like most folks, I first saw the <a href="www.amazon.com/Catch-You-Widescreen-Two-Disc-Special/dp/B00005JLSB/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_14_img_0?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=9SYGYHC9FW7WSZ5005EG&tag=dankuck-20">film version</a> of Frank Abagnale, Junior's /Catch Me If You Can/.

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Catch-Me-If-You-Can/dp/0767905385?tag=dankuck-20">The book</a> is stupendous.

It's billed as the true story of Frank Abagnale, Junior a now famous imposter who posed as a doctor and an airline pilot in the 1960's, mainly as a way of advancing check fraud schemes.

But there's another author on the cover named Stan Redding. Since the book was published, Frank admitted that it is somewhat embellished by him. Maybe that will explain the ending when I spoil it in a moment.

But what else would we expect from an admitted and convicted fraudster? And a good one. Con artists are good at making you like them, and this book succeeds at making you like Frank Abagnale, Jr.

If you're familiar with the film, there are some big differences. For the film, a single FBI dectective was invented. There was no single FBI detective doggedly pursuing Abagnale across country and continents. In fact, it wasn't just the FBI, but almost every country he lived in or visited was on the look out for Abagnale. And several of them caught him.

The ending is another difference. The end of the book never gets to Abagnale's filmatic absolution either. In the film as in real life, Abagnale was freed on the condition that he would help the FBI catch check fraudsters like himself. Instead, at the end of the book, when the FBI has Abagnale's hotel surrounded and he has nowhere to go, he gets out anyway and walks off into the darkness.

Maybe that's a clue that the book is partly fiction for sake of drama. In real life, there has to be some connection from the resolution of a true story to the part where the anti-hero tells all in a best-selling novel.

Not to harp on it, but it is a thrilling book.

Frank starts off with a simple check book his father gave him. He soon realizes that he can write checks even if he has no money in the bank.

And for a long time that's all he does. He writes bad checks and gets out of town as quick as he can. It's not clever, it's just fraud.

Frank sort of stumbles onto the realization that he can impersonate a pilot. That's when he starts to become ingenious. He realizes that as a pilot people will trust him. And since trust is the key to fraud, he looks for a way to get a real pilot's uniform.

As it turns out, just calling Pan Am's headquarters and saying you've ruined your uniform is all it takes. Whereas he was just trying to figure out where to go to buy an authentic uniform, they sent him there and charged it to Pan Am's account.

He gets more and more clever after that. Eventually he settles down in an apartment complex with a pile of money and he needs an explanation.

So he tells everyone he's a pediatrician taking a year off. That works fine until one of his neighbors who is a doctor, begs him to take a shift as a supervisor at the local hospital.

Somehow Frank can't say no, and he winds up supervising for six months. Most of that time is spent hiding out on a forgotten floor under construction so no one will ask him to do anything. But he recounts one incident where he almost killed a boy. The boy lived.

Staying on the move seems to be a requirement for someone who can't keep to himself, so Frank has a few more adventures before being caught in Italy, again living a relaxing life with a pile of money.

Italy doesn't keep him though. They send him to France and to one of the most harrowing supposedly true stories I've heard.

To hear him tell it, France kept Frank Abagnale, Junior in a pitch black cell that he couldn't stand up in with only a bucket for facilities for six months. This is the part of the story you have to hear because he goes on about it at length.

After serving half of a twelve month sentence, Frank is taken to Sweden. Yes all of these countries have evidence pinning Frank to crimes within their borders. You start to think he might not be a master criminal after all.

But Sweden's justice system was and remains a wonderful place to be. A Swedish prison is like a dormatory and Frank had a private room. He had a comfortable bed and good food and no bars on the doors.

Frank even considered leaving once. But then he realized he couldn't. He had nowhere to go. So he was a prisoner after all.

After six months in Sweden, he was able to convince a judge to let the United States extradite him. He would be sent to jail there, but he could not be extradited to any other country once he was in the US. Frank sincerely told the judge that he had converted.

But it didn't last long.

Swedish police escorted Frank to a jet plane that flew him, all alone, to the United States. But this was a model of plane that Frank was familiar with. During the flight, he visited the lavatory and loosened some screws. When the plane landed, while it taxied, Frank lifted the entire toilet to reveal enough space to crawl down to the baggage compartment. There he jumped out of the hole that houses the landing gear and scaled a fence. The US authorities did not catch him that day.

Frank remained at large and had several other run ins with the law until finally they caught up to him at his hotel. They had it surrounded, but nobody had told the foot patrol how to deal with a con artist. Frank crawled out a back window unseen and when two officers stopped him, he told them he was an officer and they were wanted in the front of the hotel. He walked into the darkness and the story ends there.

I said why I think the story is embellished, but there is more. In 1978, before the book was published, a San Francisco Chronicle reporter with an advanced copy contacted several of the places mentioned in the book. A lot of them claim to have never had incidents like those described.

The real Abagnale shrugs that off and says they probably wouldn't admit it out of embarrassment. In fact, we still assume today that a lot of businesses do not publicize successful hacking intrusions against them, for the same reason. Just as easily, the businesses may not know they were robbed or they may have forgotten.

Or, Frank Abagnale, Junior could have told a true story with the wrong names, either to cover himself legally or because he is such a bullshitter that he doesn't even care whether the events he remembers even happened the way he remembers them.

Whatever the case, it's a good story, with a lot of lessons to be learned about trusting people and gaining trust. Just remember to use your powers for good and not evil.

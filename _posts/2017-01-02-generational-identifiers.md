This post is not about semantics.

In the English-speaking world we like to group people according to what year range they were born in. This is appropriate about 10% of the time and the rest of the time it allows people to generalize about each other.

But what use is a generation if not to generalize?

Anyway, besides being wrong 9 out of 10 times, the generations we've mapped out have large gaps between them. That's where I come in.

I mean, that's where I came in, I was born in one of those gaps.

The generations are named the following:

* Baby Boomers
* Generation X
* Millennials
* Generation Z

There are no official definitions of these words. If the government has definitions written somewhere nobody cares. Everyone old is now a Baby Boomer. Every child is Generation Z. 

Born in 1981, I'm sometimes called a Millennial. And then again sometimes not.

Granted, I don't want to be a Millennial. Some of my best friends are millennials but they have different interests from me. Meanwhile, I'm not Generation X. I didn't grow up afraid of the Russkies. When I was a teenager, counter-culture was already mainstream.

But I share a lot with both groups. What we need is an overlapping system. Everyone should belong to two groups. Here are my suggetions:

* 1945-1964: The Economic Boomers
* 1955-1974: The Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds
* 1965-1984: The Counter Culturalists
* 1975-1994: The Apple II's
* 1985-2004: The Internets
* 1995-2014: The New Recessionists
* 2005-2024: ???

The Boomers get to keep that monicker that are comfortable with. And everyone else gets two generations. My class is the Counter Culturalist Apple II's. My parents are the LSD Boomers. My kids are both Recessionist Question Marks. Their future isn't written yet.

So that's my proposal. We can make hashtags or something.

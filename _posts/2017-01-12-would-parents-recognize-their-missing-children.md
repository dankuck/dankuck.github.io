I found this question <a href="https://www.quora.com/If-a-child-went-missing-when-they-were-extremely-young-say-4-or-5-would-their-parents-still-recognise-them-if-they-were-found-as-a-teenager">on Quora</a>.

Here's my answer:

People can go through a lot or only a little change in appearance in 10+ years.

So instead of just recognizing them by sight, there are a few other things parents could do:

* Four is an age where kids are fully aware of their world. If the parents bothered to tell them their full name, the child might remember. However, children forget a lot of stuff around that age.
* Many districts put a baby’s footprint with its birth certificate.
* DNA comparisons can tell with a high degree of confidence whether two biological parents are related to a child. For adopted parents, there is no way to use this.

It’s a good idea to collect photos, finger prints, and hair follicles with the roots still on before a child goes missing, so that police can catalog those things if an investigation becomes necessary.

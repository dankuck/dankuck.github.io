bf6yo_description: "what a business has"
---

I've been ramping up A.'s knowledge of business. So first we discussed <a href="/2016/12/03/business-for-6-year-olds-part-1.html">what a business is</a> and we worked together to find some examples.

Later that night we discussed what a business has:

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>So A., remember this morning we talked about what a business is?</dd>

<dt>A.</dt>
<dd>Yep!</dd>

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>Do you know we know someone who runs a gymnastics business.</dd>

<dt>A.</dt>
<dd>Wow, who?</dd>

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>Aunt Paula and uncle Bob. Do you know what they do?</dd>

<dt>A.</dt>
<dd>Oh yeah, they're gymnastics teachers!</dd>

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>That's right, and they have their own gym. And do you know who else has their own business?</dd>

<dt>A.</dt>
<dd>Who?</dd>

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>Uncle Ladd and aunt Rose.</dd>

<dt>A.</dt>
<dd>What do they do?</dd>

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>They take old furniture and replace the cloth on it and some of the pieces inside so it's new and nice.</dd>

<dt>A.</dt>
<dd><i>(Excited)</i> I want to have a business like that!</dd>

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>Well, unfortunately it's a difficult business to be in, because people aren't doing that as much as they used to. They aren't having their furniture fixed very often.</dd>

<i>A. looks dejected here.</i>

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>But it could be a good hobby. You'd probably have a lot of fun.</dd>

<dt>A.</dt>
<dd>Yes!</dd>

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>And you know who else has a business?</dd>

<dt>A.</dt>
<dd>Who?</dd>

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>Papi Percy and Mami Lucy! <i>(Her grandparents.)</i> Do you know what they do?</dd>

<dt>A.</dt>
<dd>They build buildings! Mami has that business. <i>(My wife.)</i></dd>

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>That's right. Mami was trained to do that. She doesn't do it right now.</dd>

<i>I let A. think about all these things for a few minutes before I continue. It's time to explain what a business has. Which will help differentiate it from other concepts like "a job".</i>

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>So A., what does a business have?</dd>

<dt>A.</dt>
<dd><i>(Thinks real hard.)</i></dd>

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>Like, what does a gardener have?</dd>

<dt>A.</dt>
<dd>Oh! Something to dig with!</dd>

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>Yes! A shovel.</dd>

<dt>A.</dt>
<dd>And flowers.</dd>

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>Yes, and what does a house-cleaning person need?</dd>

<dt>A.</dt>
<dd>Um, something to clean with.</dd>

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>Yes. Sometimes they go and just use the cleaning stuff that is already at the house, but sometimes they bring their own cleaning stuff.</dd>
<dd>What does a garbage company need?</dd>

<dt>A.</dt>
<dd>Um... Oh! A garbage truck!</dd>

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>Yep. That's almost all they need. They also need a place to keep their garbage truck. Maybe they own a place or maybe they pay someone to use their place to keep their garbage truck in.</dd>
<dd>So what does an architect need? What do Papi Percy and Mami Lucy need?</dd>

<dt>A.</dt>
<dd>Um... what's that stuff that holds bricks together?</dd>

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>Cement, yes they need cement.</dd>

<i>(About this time, my wife Pati came in the kitchen.)</i>

<dt>A.</dt>
<dd>And bricks! If the house is made of bricks.</dd>

<dt>Pati</dt>
<dd>Yep. And they also need a computer.</dd>

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>Yeah, to draw what they're going to build. They might draw the idea first on paper, but then they use a computer to make sure they know exactly how big everything has to be.</dd>

<i>I let her think about that stuff for just a moment.</i>

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>There's one thing that all businesses have to have.</dd>

<dt>A.</dt>
<dd>Money?</dd>

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>Actually yes, they all need that. And where do they get it?</dd>

<dt>A.</dt>
<dd><i>(Pause.)</i></dd>

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>Where does a gardener get money?</dd>

<dt>A.</dt>
<dd>From the people who live in the garden.</dd>

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>From the people who own the garden.</dd>

<dt>A.</dt>
<dd>That's what I said!</dd>

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>Ok, you're right. Yes, the people who own the garden pay the gardener to mow their lawn and plant their flowers. They're called the customers.</dd>
<dd>Who are the customers of a house-cleaning person?</dd>

<dt>A.</dt>
<dd>The people who live in the house.</dd>

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>That's right. Who are the customers of a gymnastics business? It's not the kids. It's the parents, right?</dd>

<dt>A.</dt>
<dd><i>(Nods.)</i></dd>

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>If a business doesn't have customers it is not a business.</dd>

<dt>A.</dt>
<dd>Who is the customer of the firetruck?</dd>

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>Firefighters are a different story. If they had customers, then only people who could afford firefighters would have their houses saved from fires. The same is true for policemen...</dd>

Then I started talking about government and didn't come back to the topic of business.

Planet of the Apes blew audiences away in 1968. After an hour and 50 minutes of a great movie, its ending really stoked the audience's excitement.

Now, everyone knows the ending going into the movie. And that's fine. It's fine that the ending is spoiled by the DVD cover, because the movie is so great. 

It's fine that Taylor's final words echoed in our everyday language for decades, because the film is about Taylor's journey. It's fine that we now know that Charlton Heston was on Earth all along, because the ending doesn't actually matter.

They could have left the ending out. The film works great without it. They put it in as a big reveal to excite the audience.

But why didn't they see it coming?

I was introduced to the film long after its release. I knew the ending. I gather that a lot of people were surprised in 1968. I think I know why.

There were a lot of clues to the ending. The planet had humans. The characters excavate advanced human artifacts from a previous era. All the characters spoke English!

But this wasn't enough in the 1960's.

## Weren't The Humans a Tipoff?

That the planet was inhabited by humans was and still is the least useful clue. We still have no clue what an alien would look like. If they had been planning to populate a new planet, they would probably pick one like Earth. And Earth might just happen to have ape-like creatures on it. Including a few hairless ones.

For a film, it makes perfect sense. In the 60's film makers didn't have the resources we have now. So if your brain started tingling with feelings of Maybe This Is a Clue, you probably just ignored it as "a movie can't be more advanced than this". Most people were used to this, and didn't get that brain tingle at all.

## When The Apes Spoke English, Surely That Was A Clue

There was a lot of lead up to the first ape speaking. And speaking English! This was a real clue.

But to the audiences of 1968, it was easy to ignore. Star Trek was just getting popular and all of the aliens in that series spoke English. For a decade all sci-fi had everyone speak English.

Recently we have started to demand that aliens speak something else and learn English. Or else they must explain how they know English. For realism.

But in 1968, everything spoke the language of the audience. No explanation was necessary.

## Didn't They Wonder About The Twist?

Sixties audiences didn't expect twists.

If I'm right, it explains a lot. Nobody had a tiny M. Night Shyamalan living in their brain in the 1960's. Every film has exposition. There are things constantly being revealed at just the right moment to astound the audience. But there weren't so many twists.

It was natural for an audience to think that what they were told by the film was exactly the truth. We still do this most of the time. If we lost this trust, fiction wouldn't be fun anymore. But now we are on the look out for secrets, too.

I recently had a conversation about recent history which reminded me how pliable human memory is. I saw again how difficult it is to keep even recent events straight when they are convoluted enough to make Google searches difficult. Bad actors can exploit the weaknesses in our memory to twist our perceptions and support their own narrative.

This was about the Boy Scouts of America.

It was brought to my attention that President Barack Obama tried to shut the Boy Scouts down during his tenure.

Except that's not true. In fact, there are two levels of misdirection going on in that statement. The first lie is that Obama attempted to shut down the Boy Scouts. The second lie is that Obama took any action against the Boy Scouts at all.

So it's easy to hear the statement "Obama tried to shut down the Scouts" and react with "Well probably not, I wonder what he really was doing..." But if that's your reaction, you've already been duped. Obama barely did anything, and here you are already remembering it as if he did something to harm the Boy Scouts.

Maybe you don't remember the events at all, so I'll share my false memories with you.

In my memory, Obama ordered that Boy Scouts could not rent public spaces as long as they rejected gay members.

That's not at all what happened. In fact, it's so much not what happened, this false memory made it hard for me to even find evidence for what *did* happen.

Here's what happened.

In 2013, Barack Obama said in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgkf47t9v3E">an interview</a> that he hoped the Boy Scouts of America would end its ban on gays.

One friend of mine claimed that this event started a "firestorm of criticism against the BSA." That includes losses of sponsorships from big donors. But he's wrong, because the trouble did not start with that interview at all.

<a href="http://nws.mx/2vemqpo">NewsMax</a> says that the protests against BSA's policy started as early as a Supreme Court case in 2000.

The article doesn't clarify whether those protests included sponsors dropping out. What we can say is that this was an old dispute by the time of Obama's interview.

And we can be sure that sponsors weren't jumping ship much before July 2012 when <a href="http://bit.ly/2u4XRWT">The American Independent</a> reported on it. But by September that year, well yeah actually they were starting to jump ship when <a href="http://bit.ly/2eU0dWC">GLAAD</a> and <a href="http://bit.ly/2v4FR3k">The Advocate</a> reported on it. This was all before the Obama interview.

On the other hand, that speech wasn't the first time Obama discussed it. Maybe the first time Obama mentioned gay scout members was the real trouble. At first, it looks that way, because Obama first came out against the ban on gay scouts in August 2012, right between the dates I mentioned above when sponsors started dropping out.

On August 8, 2012, Obama expressed his opinion on the scouting ban for the first time. And the reason he felt compelled to discuss it was obvious to anyone who heard it at the time. Because that was the day after his presidential opponent <a href="http://cnn.it/2uF4frt">Mitt Romney came out with a similar stance</a>.

Yes, Mitt Romney is more to blame for the Boy Scouts' troubles than Obama was, if the timeline tells us anything. But why did Mitt Romney start to concern himself with the Boy Scouts? Was it his idea that the scouts should accept gay members?

Mitt Romney is not known as a great champion of gay rights.

By making this statement, Romney was going against the opinions of his own church, The Mormon Church, a major supporter of both the Boy Scouts and Romney himself. The Mormon Church threatened to pull support from the Boy Scouts if they accepted gay members and leaders.

If even Mitt Romney felt the need to support gay scouts, then we can infer that it was a matter of public concern already. If there was public outcry from possible voters over this issue, that could steer Mitt Romney to take a stand for gay scouts.

The public outcry was there before Mitt Romney and before Barack Obama. Barack Obama's interview didn't cause the outcry. The outcry caused his interview.

I rate the claim that Obama purposefully and maliciously attacked the Boy Scouts as Pants on Fire. Obama held his tongue until Romney started to look more liberal than him. Perhaps he held his tongue precisely because he didn't want a firestorm to start.

In Obama's statement about gay scouts his spokesman said "The President believes the Boy Scouts is a valuable organization that has helped educate and build character in American boys for more than a century."

Obama likes the Boy Scouts of America.

Nothing suggests that Obama wanted to shut the Scouts down.

But my memory does hold something about Scouts getting pushed out of public buildings due to their policy on gay members.

It turns out that part was true. But it never had anything to do with Obama. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/06/us/06scouts.html">Here's one</a> from Philadelphia in 2007 before Obama's first presidential run began.

So if you pull together some true things and count on people not remembering the details, you can spin a lie that will pass several glances.

It was hard for me to even find some of the history, partly because I was trying to find anything related to Obama and much of it simply didn't have anything to do with him.

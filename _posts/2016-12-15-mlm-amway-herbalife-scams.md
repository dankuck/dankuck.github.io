I found this question <a href="https://www.quora.com/Why-do-people-believe-MLM-is-a-scam">on Quora</a>.

MLM means Multi-Level Marketing. Some popular examples are Amway and Herbalife.

My answer: 

There are a lot of reasons, but the one that scares me the most is the answers you get from MLM’s when you ask for some evidence to show how many of their members actually succeed.

If you can get a number at all, it'll be very low and it'll probably be accompanied by excuses that blame the members for not being committed enough. Whether that's true or not, it doesn't seem to matter enough for the MLM’s to fix that problem.

They're happy to take your money even if you're extremely likely to fail. And that's why it's a scam.

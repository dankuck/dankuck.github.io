I found this question <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-wrong-with-me-since-I-was-born-two-weeks-earlier">on Quora</a>.

Here's my answer:

Births are timed at 40 weeks after the last menstruation of the mother. This is an estimate which can be wrong by several weeks.

Being born two weeks early is within the normal range. You were probably only early compared to what your parents expected. Each baby is born when they are ready.

However, if you were actually born before you were ready, you may have had underdeveloped lungs. Those are the last organs to fully develop before birth. By now, you probably have no lasting effects from it.

When I was a computer science teacher, I put a lot of effort into making a text game with the intention of using it to teach. It was unsuccessful.

I've learned a lot since then about wasting effort and about simplifying things for audiences.

## Wasted Effort 1: Making it speak English

A MUD is a game played by typing and reading text along with other users. It looks like this:

```
You are standing in a grassy field. You see cow and empty bucket.

> milk cow

You milk the cow. Milk goes everywhere, so you stop.

> milk cow with bucket

You milk the cow. Now you see cow and bucket of milk.
```

For game purposes, it's great that you can type commands in English. And I worked to make it possible in the MUD I designed for the class.

But I was trying to teach Java. I should have forgotten all about English.

So it should have looked like this:

```
You are standing in a dark hallway. You see torch and bucket. Inside bucket you see milk.

> pickup(torch)

You now have the torch.

> put(torch, bucket.getItem('milk'))

You put the torch in the milk. It's a lot darker now.
```

This would have actually taught the students in a fun manner, and it would have been a lot less effort on my part making the English-parsing code.

## Wasted Effort 2: Having No Goal

I wrote the game first and devised the lessons second. I more or less never got to the part about devising lessons.

The only lesson I gave was how to get started and how to play around.

But now I'm a test-driven development guy, and so I should have planned what I would do with the software before I planned what the software would do.

## Wasted Effort 3: Not Trusting My Audience

I thought by making it respond to English and by letting it be a free-for-all type of system, I was making it simpler. This just goes to show that simple isn't a well-defined word.

In fact, I didn't trust my audience enough to understand what I wanted to tell them. This probably affected all of my teaching.

I expected them to learn Java by creating objects inside the MUD game. When I should have trusted that it would click for them as they played the game. And that would turn them on to the deeper opportunities to use code to be creative.

## Story-Telling Mistakes

A game is a story. I wanted to create a sandbox game, and even that has characters and settings and atmosphere.

So here was my big mistake:

I didn't provide a list of what commands would work.

One thing you should never do in a story is keep secrets. Game players must know what they can do or they aren't interested.

I thought completely backwards, that the fun was trying things and seeing what could work.

But this was not fun, it was frustrating:

```
You are in a broken down shack. You see: door.

> open door

The door is already open.

> use door

I don't understand.

> walk through door

I don't understand.

> go through door

You go through the door.
You are in a broken down front yard. You see: door and path
```

I should have just told them what commands they could make. Here's what they needed:
```
You are in the belly of a ship. You see: stairs.
Try "look at stairs".

> look at stairs

The stairs are old, but they should hold you.
You can: climb

> climb stairs

You are on the deck of a ship. You feel like you could go anywhere. You see: stairs, bow, stern, Salty Jim.
```

I've seen and read a lot of time travel fiction. Here are my ratings for all the time travel movies I can remember. I don't think it's smart to compare dramatic time travel with comedic, so I split them up.

<div style="clear: both"></div>

## Dramatic

</div>

### Dramatic Good

* [Looper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3yDHl_MBM)<br />Hitmen kill people from the future, including themselves, until Bruce Willis decides something different.
* [Los Cronocrimenes (aka Timecrimes)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtL-3iEInQI)<br />Everything about this is a spoiler.
* [ARQ](https://www.netflix.com/title/80092885)<br />When you die you go back to the beginning.
* [Star Trek (2009)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTzIaSQwxCU)<br />Spock accidentally resets time and causes a lot of lens flares.
* [Terminator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fN82upbGPo)<br />Robot wrapped in skin has to kill a lady but fails.
* [Terminator 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut0PQ5sTDu0)<br />Robot wrapped in skin has to save a kid.

* [The Caller](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4jMiH6cDtE)<br />Young lady gets horrified by old lady's phone calls from the past.

### Dramatic Bad
* Planet of the Apes (2001)<br />Marky Mark chases a monkey through space, but time is backwards so things go all wrong.
* The Time Machine (2002)<br />Fate is a jerk, so scientist Guy Pierce just goes to the future instead.
* The Time Traveler's Wife<br />A genetic mutation makes Eric Bana travel through time naked, but it doesn't make up for bad acting by both him and Rachel McAdams.
* The Lake House<br />It's like Speed but slower and there's a magic mailbox.
* Escape from the Planet of the Apes<br />People in ape masks look less realistic when they visit the 70's.

### Dramatic Ugly
* Premonition<br />Sandra Bullock can't make anything coherent happen.
* Sound of Thunder<br />They kill a butterfly or something.
* Freejack<br />Emelio Estevez should have died in a race car accident.

## Comedy

* Meet the Robinsons<br />It's like Dreamworks, but it's made by Disney.
* Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III<br />Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles get magicked to ancient China.

### Comedy Ugly
None

Some of these are based on books. My ratings do not reflect on the books.

I made most of this list in 2013 and got some good feedback on the following Facebook post. I haven't seen a lot of time travel movies in the last four years, pitifully. On the other hand, there are no new time travel ideas. Just new executions of the same ideas. So I haven't missed much.

I found this question <a href="https://www.quora.com/Will-killing-everybody-end-all-of-humanitys-problems">on Quora</a>.

Here's my pithy answer:

Killing everybody would replace all of humanity’s problems with the one problem of Not Existing. Not Existing is counter to most of humanity’s objectives, so it would be a big problem.

No humans would object once it’s done, but they would have if they could.

So I think I adequately explained to A. what the difference is between <a href="/2016/12/06/business-for-6-year-olds-part-3.html">a job and a business</a>. But she was getting bored of talking about business all the time. So I've been looking for places to sneak in discussions about business that don't use the word. Since every business has an industry, I've been naming those instead.

So while we were making pancakes, we had this conversation:

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>What if we opened a restaurant that just served pancakes?</dd>

<dt>A.</dt>
<dd>That would be fun!</dd>

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>What things would we need?</dd>

<dt>A.</dt>
<dd>We'd need pancake mix, and butter, and pans...</dd>

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>And a building</dd>

<dt>A.</dt>
<dd>Yeah, and water, and a kitchen...</dd>

She added more things to the list, and I mentioned a cash register.

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>So if we sold this restaurant what would the people who buy it get?</dd>

<dt>A.</dt>
<dd>All that stuff.</dd>

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>Yeah, the building and the pancake mix and the kitchen...</dd>

So that worked out. I'm gonna continue with these sorts of exercises for a while. The next level will be to discuss owning only part of a business. That feels like a big leap conceptually, so I'm going to spend the interim looking for smaller steps.

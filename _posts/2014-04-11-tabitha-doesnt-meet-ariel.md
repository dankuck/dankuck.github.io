One time Tabitha was waiting in line to meet Ariel.

Remember, Tabitha never washed her hair, so it was very dirty.



Then the wind blew a bunch of dirt out of Tabitha's hair and it made a big black cloud.

Everybody coughed and had to run away, even Ariel. So Tabitha couldn't meet her.

But she did get to meet Cinderella.

I found this question <a href="https://www.quora.com/When-we-die-we-lose-our-consciousness-Do-we-become-another-human-after-we-die/">on Quora</a>.

Here's my answer:

Who is to say we don’t become another human even before we die? Just, bloop, a copy of your soul goes into some baby’s body, meanwhile your original soul is comfortable at home in you.

Heck, let’s imagine copies of your particular soul go into all the bodies of all the babies born throughout the eastern hemisphere today.

Of course, your soul-copy-babies don’t retain your memories. Memories are held by your personal brain. We can see this because memories are damaged when your brain is damaged. And your soul-copy-babies don’t act like you. We can see that when they grow up and behave differently.

So what’s the difference? Maybe all those baby souls are copies of yours, but unless you have some way to show it, it is the same as if they were created from scratch. It’s the same as if souls didn’t even exist.

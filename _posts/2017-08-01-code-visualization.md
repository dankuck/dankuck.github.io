Last week, I tried to have a conversation with my wife Patricia about messy computer code. She's an architect, so I looked for ways to describe the issue on my mind at work. A tool in the software we write at LotVantage has been copied four times and these pages have gotten out of sync with each other.

I couldn't find an analogy.

In software development we have concepts like DRY code, where DRY means don't repeat yourself, and spaghetti code which describes a single file where references jump around a lot.

These aren't things in architecture.

Whether you're working on architecture software like AutoCAD or graphing things old school, you just don't have messes caused by excessive references and duplication.

I think a lot of it has to do with the visual nature of architecture. Architecture is a nearly concrete activity. It's abstraction, the blue print, is very close to the final result, the structure.

Software design is so abstract that you don't even get to see the results during most of its lifetime. Almost all of the usages of your software will be by your customers and you don't get to see over their shoulders.

So my first instinct is to bridge that gap by getting a blue print of my computer code.

Computer code visualization hasn't caught on. And it's probably because it's not very good. It's definitely not intuitive.

One reason might be that code is just too abstract. There are too many things you might want to do. A generic set of visualizations for code might just be too useless. And so a useful visualization would have to be created each time a new piece of code was written, just for that code.

Maybe an architect has such a great and useful tool because they are already working with a world that has most of the same base rules every time.

So I'm on a quest to find a way to visualize code.

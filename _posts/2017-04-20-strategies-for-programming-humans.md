I grocery shop once each week without fail. I have had lots of time to contemplate a strategy to complete it faster. I think I have a good one.

I probably spend too much time contemplating strategies and processes like this without really getting much out of it. It's pleasant but somewhat stressful.

I spend my professional time doing the same thing, but not for humans like me. Instead I contemplate computer processes.

The differences between humans and computers are striking. Here are some of them:

1. Humans can't remember things very well. So for a grocery process, a human will naively spend a lot of time checking their grocery list.
2. Computers will check the list constantly, but they'll do it very fast.

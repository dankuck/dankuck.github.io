You might have noticed that the science taught to kids in school looks different from the science you're supposed to know all about when you argue on the Internet. And they both look different from science as practiced in TV shows.

There are actually four things called science. These are them.

<dt>Science The Facts</dt>
<dd>In school, Science is the name for facts about each scientific domain. Carbon has 6 electrons. Dogs are mammals. Mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell.</dd>

Mitochondria, by Mariana Ruiz Villarreal LadyofHats. Don't you feel scienced now?

<dd>These are the things that you have to ingest and regurgitate with as little digestion as possible. They are important because, if you engage in science, you will use these facts to lead you to undiscovered facts. Facts that save lives or make better armchair cushions.</dd>

<dd>But if you forgot these facts yourself, you could still get them from the people who use them every day. The institution people.</dd>

<dt>Science The Institution</dt>
<dd>The people who engage in scientific work are sometimes called Science, too. They make up the great institution called Science which has the duty of guarding all the scientific facts and coming up with new ones.</dd>

<dd>The most common time for anyone to use the word is in just one phrase: "Science doesn't know why a bee can fly." They are the science, in that sentence. And it's a dirty lie.</dd>

<dd>The mechanism by which a bee flies has been <a href="http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2013/08/bumblebee-flight-does-not-violate-the-laws-of-physics/">well understood</a> for quite a long time. The confusion is that one time one of those people who are part of Science said something to the effect of "If an airplane were the size of a bee, it wouldn't be able to fly." And then I assume the fake news sites got ahold of it.</dd>

<dd>Science does a lot of good in the world. And when that good is done, Science means people.</dd>

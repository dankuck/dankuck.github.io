You might have noticed that the science taught to kids in school looks different from the science you're supposed to know all about when you argue on the Internet. And they both look different from science as practiced in TV shows.

There are actually four things called science. These are them.

<dt>Science The Facts</dt>
<dd>In school, science is boiled down to facts about each scientific domain. Carbon has 6 electrons. Dogs are mammals. Mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell.</dd>

Mitochondria, by Mariana Ruiz Villarreal LadyofHats. Don't you feel scienced now?

<dd>These are the things that you have to ingest and regurgitate with as little digestion as possible. They are important because, if you engage in science, you will use these facts to lead you to undiscovered facts. Facts that save lives or make better armchair cushions.</dd>

<dd>But if you forgot these facts yourself, you could still get them from the people who use them every day. The institution people.</dd>

<dt>Science The Institution</dt>

<dt>Scientific Exploration</dt>

<dt>The Scientific Method</dt>

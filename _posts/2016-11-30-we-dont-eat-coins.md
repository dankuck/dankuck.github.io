When my daughter was two years old, I needed a way to kindly teach her that we do not put coins in our mouths. So I made it a simple game. 


<dt>Do we eat oatmeal?</dt>
<dd>Yes!</dd>
<dt>Do we eat cheese?</dt>
<dd>Yes!</dd>
<dt>Do we eat coins?</dt>
<dd>No</dd>

A popular one was "Do we eat sharks?"

Then she would ask me questions. Pretty soon she stopped putting coins in her mouth.

My reach goal was that I could teach her to eat new foods. That failed miserably.

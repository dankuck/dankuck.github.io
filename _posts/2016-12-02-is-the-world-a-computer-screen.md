I found this question on Quora.

The analogy to a computer screen fails in some ways. A computer screen is the part of a computer that shows information that has been calculated somewhere else.

An analogy to an entire computer would be more appropriate. The universe appears to do all its own calculations. There is no part that is obviously a screen that some external person can view. We are inside the computer and so are interacting directly with the other parts of it without need for a screen.

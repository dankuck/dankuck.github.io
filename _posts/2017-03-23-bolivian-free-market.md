I have done a lot of traveling to just one country, and so I tend to start too many sentences with "In Bolivia...".

After a few of these stories, someone pointed out to me that Bolivians are creative at money making in ways people just don't think of in the United States. I've been struck by how similar South American countries really are, so I'll bet the following examples happen all the way from Mexico to southern Chile.

### Paid Protesters

In the US, we are not used to the kind of corruption that happens in developing nations. But we think we are.

Here political parties accuse each other of paying people to protest. In Bolivia, paid protesters work as a standard part of the political scene. When interviewed, they sometimes don't even know what they are protesting. They are just there to get in the way.

### Line Holders

To replace your expired government issued ID in Bolivia, you need to wait in line at a place like the DMV. So you wake up, have your tea, then head out the door at 8 to discover the line is already around the block. Some of these people have been waiting since 4 AM. You're in for a dull morning.

The good news is, if you have the cash, you can buy a place near the front of the line. Several of the people in line don't even need their ID's replaced. They're just waiting so they can sell their place to you. If you're too late for those people, you can probably still find someone. People are very willing to exchange convenience for money.

### Professional Criers

Each year on November 2nd, All Saints Day is celebrated with typical South American tardiness and flare. You get together with your family to visit the graves of the dearly departed and share a meal.

If you feel the need to cry, but you just can't muster up any tears, don't worry. At any moment you could be addressed by a lady offering to do it for you, for a small price. And the Beatles said money can't buy love.

### Cocaine

Bolivia has seen a boom in its economy for the last decade. Some like to attribute this to their leftist regime change. Other less optimistic analysts point to the most obvious boom industry in Bolivia, cocaine.

After taking office in 2005, Bolivian President Evo Morales kicked out the United States' DEA from Bolivia. Morales ran a pro-coca, pro-leftist, pro-change campaign. Of all those pros, one of them had to work out for the best. Turns out by kicking out the DEA, he was opening a free market for coca and cocaine, its most popular derivative product.

From its creative endeavors like professional crying, to more common established industries like drug production, Bolivia has consistently taught me lessons about the free market. I don't applaud all of them, but I'm consistently impressed.

The following is a common process in software development:

1. A stakeholder (a customer or a manager) writes a requirements document in plain language.

2. Developers then create a plan to implement the requirements document.

3. The product is sent to the stakeholder to evaluate.

4. The stakeholder identifies any mistaken understandings or requirement changes in plain language.

5. The developers adjust the software to meet the new understanding or requirements.

6. Steps 3 to 5 repeat as many times as needed.

7. The product is launched.

8. After some amount of time, steps 1 to 7 are repeated to make changes.

The above generally describes a rapid application development process for producing functional software with changing requirements.

There are several cycles in the process where the requirements for the system are changed.

When these changes occur, its is difficult to revisit all of the original requirements and consider the new requirements in light of them. Some of the original requirements are likely to be removed at this point. Some are likely to be added. No one saves the original requirements documents. Emails get lost.

Eventually, the true requirements for the system are unclear. Often developers and stakeholders only remember the most recent requirements, the most recent feature that the system supports, or the features involved with the most recent reformation of the business's direction.

It is necessary for a business to consider the old requirements of a system and discard them if they are unneeded, or address their affects on any new requirements.

Requirements specifications are the solution.

Requirements specifications have fallen out of favor due to the perception that they do not work with or are not necessary in rapid application development.

Also, in older development processes, requirements specifications are burdensome.

In this document I attempt to define a non-burdensome process for the use of a requirements specification in an rapidly-changing software development environment.

The LWR Spec Specification conforms to the LWR Spec Specification.

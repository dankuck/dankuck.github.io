Here's my tip for cleaning a messy house: Use a laundry basket.

Clean just room at a time, such as the living room. As you organize that room, put away anything that belongs there. Everything else, and anything you're not sure about, goes into the basket.

When that room is organized, you have a choice. You may organize another room in the same way, or you may address the basket.

Be honest though, you will probably just leave the basket where it was. Because the basket seems much less messy than the room was.

This runs the risk of a lost toy and the ensuing ruination of children's lives.

Instead of ruining your child's life, carry the basket to each room of your house. Start with the room where you estimate that most of the things belong. Or just start at the kids' room, because that's always the right answer.

This is the bussing part. Put away anything that goes in the first room. If you're working alone, you can probably do this item-by-item, then move on to the next room as soon as you're pretty sure you got everything. You're wrong. You didn't get everything. But in the interest of time, you shouldn't dig too deep in that basket. In the end you'll probably come back just once.

If you're getting your kids involved, dump the whole basket on the floor. Tell them to put away things that belong in the room and put anything else back into the basket. This will take forever, but it's a solid plan that a kid can understand. And it creates another generation of basket bus drivers, thus cementing my personal contribution to the world forever.

When you've visited each room, you'll have a little stuff left. Make the rounds one more time.

When you've visited each room again, throw away everything else. You probably don't even own that stuff. You don't want the police to find it in your house.

Now you're ready to start on the second room. Tomorrow.

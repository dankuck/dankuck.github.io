I found this question <a href="https://www.quora.com/As-a-teenager-if-youve-screwed-up-a-few-times-in-the-past-how-do-you-ask-your-parents-for-a-clean-slate-if-youre-trying-to-start-over/">on Quora</a>.

Here's my answer:

You might choose to setup an accountability system with them.

I’ll choose school grades as an innocuous example.

If you want them to trust you to do your homework, get them to check up on you every day. If they do that, it will annoy you into doing your homework before they ask. Then they’ll start to notice that you do it. Then they’ll probably ease up without your asking them to. And maybe by then you’ll form good habits, which is a good way to actually *be* trustworthy.

Whatever your trouble is, at your age your parents are there to hold you accountable for whatever self improvements you want to make.

One time, Tabitha and her friends were playing hide and seek in the park.

The It player started counting and Tabitha ran off to find a hiding place.

She found a really great place to hide in a bush.

After all the other kids had been found and only Tabitha was left hiding,
the It player called out "Olly olly oxen free!"

Tabitha was proud of having a good hiding place.

But remember, Tabitha never washes her hair. It gets very dirty and tangled.

When she tried to come out of the bush, her hair got stuck!

She said, "Help! Help!"

All the kids came to help. They said "We'll get your mommy."

When Tabitha's mommy came, she said "Oh, Tabitha."

She cut the little tangled part of Tabitha's hair off and they went home.

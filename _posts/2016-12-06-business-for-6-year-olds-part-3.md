A. <a href="/2016/12/03/business-for-6-year-olds-part-1.html">now has a good knowledge</a> of <a href="/2016/12/05/business-for-6-year-olds-part-2.html">what businesses are</a>, but I'm pretty sure she can't distinguish them from jobs yet. So I launched into that. Unfortunately I got off on the wrong foot.

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>So business</dd>

<dt>A.</dt>
<dd>Ugh, why do we talk about business, we talked about it all weekend!</dd>

<i>Oops, do not start conversations with "So business."</i>

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>Oh, well we don't have to talk about that. I was just wondering if you know, do I have a business?</dd>

<dt>A.</dt>
<dd>Um... yes.</dd>

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>No, I don't have a business. I have a job.</dd>

<dt>Alba</dt>
<dd>What's the difference?</dd>

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>With a job, someone pays me to do work for their business. And they could ask me to leave any time.</dd>

<i>Then I said something about if someone breaks something, its the business that has to pay for it and businesses usually keep money around for that kind of reason.</i>

<dt>A.</dt>
<dd>Don't want to talk about business.</dd>

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>Ok, I just wanted to make sure you knew the difference.</dd>

<dt>A.</dt>
<dd>Of what?</dd>

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>The difference between a business and a job.</dd>

<dt>A.</dt>
<dd>What's the difference?</dd>

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>That if you have a job, they can ask you to leave anytime. But if you own a business, it's yours and no one can take it away.</dd>

Then I stopped because I had her back in an asking-questions mood and didn't want to spoil it again.

I'd call this a set back. For one thing, I'm not sure how receptive she'll be next time. I'll probably warm her up again by considering other kinds of businesses.

For another thing, I ended at a partial explanation. I didn't spark her interest to ask me something like "Why own a business?" But that'll be what I talk about next.

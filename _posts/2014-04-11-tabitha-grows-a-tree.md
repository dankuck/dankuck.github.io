One time Tabitha was walking down the sidewalk and a seed fell in her hair.

Remember Tabitha never washes her hair and so it was very dirty.

And seeds love dirt.

So the seed began to grow.

First it was a tiny plant.

And Tabitha said "What a pretty plant!"

But then it grew bigger.

And bigger.

And bigger!

Until it was so big Tabitha fell down and couldn't get up.

"Mommy! Mommy!", she said.

Her mom came and said "Oh, Tabitha."

Then she brought a saw and &lt;chir chir chir chir&gt; sawed off the tree.

And Tabitha said "Thank you, mommy."

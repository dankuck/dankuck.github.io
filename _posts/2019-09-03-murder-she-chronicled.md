Chronology of "Murder, She Wrote" Episode 3x03, 12 Oct 1986

Detective stories almost exlusively follow the detective's discovery process. When that process becomes difficult to follow, the audience cannot understand the story. One such episode of "Murder, She Wrote" is called "Unfinished Business". Laying out the story from an omniscient narrator point of view makes the plot clearer, along with its weaknesses.

In this story, a dirty cop reopens an investigation into a murder he himself committed. How Jessica Fletcher figures this out is difficult for the audience to follow. His reason for reopening the investigation is almost as murky but in short it gives him an excuse to kill a man who is blackmailing him. Here it is all laid out.


1976:

    VARIOUS LOCATIONS

    - Reporter Lowell Dixon discovers Barney Kale is a dirty cop.

    - Kale finds out Dixon will go public.

    - Separately, Dixon looks into the Lake Juniper Resort. He might not have found anything worth reporting.

    LAKE JUNIPER RESORT

    - Kale drowns Dixon in Lake Juniper.

    - Kale assists the local sheriff to investigate the murder he secretly committed.

    - Kale names the Lake Juniper Resort investors as suspects because of the potential for bad publicity:

        - Dr. Terry Mayhew

        - Jake Sandford

        - Seth Hazlitt

        - Cynthia Tate, Mayhew's secretary

    - Joe Cabrini the handyman finds out Kale committed the murder. He does not tell Kale or anyone else what he knows at this time.

    - The murder goes unsolved. Many claim it was an accident.

From 1976 to 1986, in approximately correct order:

    LAKE JUNIPER RESORT

    - Cabrini is fired and goes to prison for an unrelated offense.

    - The hotel doesn't fail, but it suffers from the publicity of the murder and the investors do not profit from it.

    - Sandford remains the hotel owner.

    VARIOUS LOCATIONS

    - The four suspects become successful separately.

    - Gary Roberts commits armed robbery and winds up in prison with Cabrini for a cellmate.

    - Cabrini tells Roberts that Kale murderered Dixon.

    - Seth meets Jessica Fletcher while living in Cabot Cove.

1986:

    VARIOUS LOCATIONS

    - Cabrini is killed in prison in an unrelated incident.

    - Roberts leaves prison and contacts Kale to blackmail him. They agree to meet at the Lake Juniper Resort.

    - Roberts tells his wife Maggie that he has a plan to get a large sum of money that is safer than bank robbery, but does not explain the blackmail plan to her.

    - Kale devises a plan to kill Roberts:

        - reopen the case;

        - kill Roberts;

        - make it look like someone was trying to kill Kale himself to prevent him solving the case.

    - Kale retires for the third or fourth time to much celebration for all the murders he has solved in 30 years.

    - At his retirement party, Kale vows to solve the murder of Lake Juniper which he actually committed.

    - Kale calls up the suspects to let them know that he'll be at the hotel investigating them again.

        - Cynthia Tate, the former secretary

        - Barney Kale, the investor

    LAKE JUNIPER RESORT - KALE'S ROOM

    - Roberts goes to Kale's room to collect the blackmail. He tells his wife that he is going because he forgot some shoes.

    - Kale shoots and kills Roberts and then breaks a lamp to make it look like a murderer was trying to kill Kale himself in the dark.

    - Kale goes into the woods to hide the murder weapon and give himself an alibi.

    - Jessica drives out to the Lake Juniper Resort with Amos looking for Seth.

    - Jessica hears Mrs. Roberts screaming about the new murder.

    - Jessica, Amos, and Mrs. Roberts look into the dark room and discover that the murdered person is Mr. Roberts.

    LAKE JUNIPER AREA

    - In the morning the local sheriff finds Seth and brings him to the hotel.

    - The sheriff's officers search the woods for murder clues.

    - Kale, who is still in the woods, harms himself and breaks a ladder by the lake to make it look like someone set a trap for him.

    - Kale discharges his weapon to draw the attention of the sheriff's officers.

    LAKE JUNIPER RESORT - LOBBY

    - Kale tells his invented story about the ladder trap.

    - Everyone assumes that the murderer waited for Kale in Kale's room and mistook Roberts for Kale.

    - Some of the suspects want to leave, but the local sheriff doesn't let them.

    - Jessica gets Maggie to tell her about Roberts' history and the vague plan to get a large sum of money.

    - Jessica insists that they investigate the murder room.

    - While Jessica, Seth, and the sheriff head to Kale's room, Kale makes an excuse to stay behind for a moment.

    - Kale poisons his own drink and writes Cynthia Tate's phone number on a slip of paper he takes from the lobby.

    LAKE JUNIPER RESORT - KALE'S ROOM

    - Jessica discovers that the lamp was turned on when it was broken, proving that the murderer knew they were killing Roberts and not Kale.

    - Jessica, Seth, the sheriff, and Kale decide that Dixon's murderer must have killed Roberts to hide what he knew.

    - Kale plants the slip of paper with the phone number.

    - Kale passes out (or pretends to), and the poison in his drink is discovered. He survives.

    LAKE JUNIPER RESORT - LOBBY

    - Jessica questions Sandford and learns about Cabrini, the handyman.

    - Jessica makes a call to Amos who has discovered more information about Roberts. She learns of Roberts history with Cabrini in prison.

    - The sheriff's officers discover the slip of paper with a phone number in Kale's room.

    - Jessica calls the number and discovers that it reaches Cynthia Tate's answering machine.

    - Jessica finds the pad of paper that Kale used to write the phone number. Jessica realizes that the number was written at the hotel, not ahead of time.

    - Jessica has a flash of realization:

        - She infers that Cabrini told Roberts who the murderer was.

        - She infers that the original murderer also killed Roberts.

        - She infers that Roberts expected to come into money via blackmail.

        - She infers that the phone number was planted in Kale's room to cast suspicions on Cynthia.

        - She infers that the murderer must be someone who was present when they investigated the hotel room.

            - Herself

            - The sheriff

            - Kale

            - Seth

        - Seth's alibi is iffy but true and Jessica trusts him.

        - Jessica knows she didn't do it and she has a solid alibi with Amos.

        - The sheriff has no motive.

        - Jessica concludes privately that Kale is the murderer.

    - Jessica tells the sheriff to call for help so she can accuse the murderer. He refuses so she asks that everyone be gathered in the lobby.

    - Jessica relays her theory and accuses Kale.

    - Kale confesses to the murders.

The way it's told, the audience doesn't really have the time to piece together the things Jessica is saying. It's possible to even miss the fact that Roberts was blackmailing Kale.

The idea that the paper must have been written in the hotel is clear, and so the idea that Roberts wrote it somewhere else and used it to communicate with Cynthia is clearly false. It follows that the phone number was planted, which means it reduces suspicion of Cynthia (a real killer would want to cast suspicions away).

But the idea that the phone number must have been planted during the search of the room is not conveyed clearly. The justification for that belief is that no one would need to plant it until after Roberts' murder.

Additionally, Jessica lets Seth off the hook because she knows him and the audience knows he is only involved to give Jessica a reason to be there in the first place. In context, it's worthless evidence. But apparently it fools Kale.

There's no real reason to not suspect the sheriff. His story wasn't really explored.

So Jessica's process of elimination is a weak way to prove guilt. It relies on getting Kale to confess. That's typical, but usually Jessica has a more solid case or a more solid way to draw out the murderer.

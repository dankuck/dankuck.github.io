I asked what fire was in a science class once. I didn't receive an answer that made any sense. Which is weird, because fire is just a gas. It looks like a gas. Just look at it. It's a gas. It's only weird because it's hot and it glows.

Which gas it is seems to be a question of what chemicals are mixed with oxygen. I'm personally satisfied to know that it is a gas.

Here's something else. What are those bubbles in boiling water? This one sounds dumb if you have already put two and two together. All bubbles are air, says your dumb brain. But you know that water turns to steam when it's too hot. I made the mistake of thinking that steam only comes from the top of water. But the hottest part of the water is at the bottom, if you're heating it from the bottom. What would steam look like if it was created at the bottom of a pot of hot water? It would look like bubbles. The bubbles are steam.

Somehow these connections fell through the cracks for me. The steam example might have been labeled in a science book. It reminds me of Richard Feynman's <a href="http://v.cx/2010/04/feynman-brazil-education">Look At The Water</a> essay. He describes how book-learning failed to connect with anything in the real world for his students in Brazil. They knew the formulas but without experiment, they didn't learn what the formulas do here in the real world.

I'm aware that the world only has matter and energy. Still this is the definition of fire:

<blockquote>
fire
/ˈfī(ə)r/
noun
1. combustion or burning, in which substances combine chemically with oxygen from the air and typically give out bright light, heat, and smoke.
"his house was destroyed by fire"
</blockquote>

Nothing about that says "glowing gas" to me. Except now that I know it's a gas, I can read that into this definition and see where it fits.

I realized about the steam bubbles while I was boiling water. I realized about fire while I was watching a fire.

There are probably a few lessons to be learned here. The first one is to notice when you have all the clues necessary to answer a question. The second one is to experiment *while* you're doing your thinking.

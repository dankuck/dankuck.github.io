When A. had learned all her letters, the next step was to teach her to recognize them when they are used. So I came up with a game.

Her absolute favorite activity on the playground had always been swings. Since she couldn't swing herself yet, I saw an opportunity.

I'd start swinging her:

<div style="clear: both"></div>

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>Ok, what letter does "banana" start with?</dd>

<dt>A.</dt>
<dd>Um...</dd>

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>What says buh?</dd>

<dt>A.</dt>
<dd>B!</dd>

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>That's right! 3 - 2 - 1 - Blast Off!</dd>

Then I'd give her a bigger push than usual. She'd laugh and meanwhile she was being classically conditioned to like phonics.

We did this for months and months. Before she learned to power her own swinging, I got the chance to enhance the game a few times:

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>What's the first letter of dog?</dd>

<dt>A.</dt>
<dd>D!</dd>

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>3 - 2 - 1 - Blast Off!</dd>
<dd>Now what's the second letter of dog?</dd>

<dt>A.</dt>
<dd>Um...</dd>

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>Take the first letter off of dog. We already did the D, the duh. So what's left is og. What's the first letter of og?</dd>

<dt>A.</dt>
<dd>O?</dd>

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>3 - 2 - 1 - Blast Off!</dd>
<dd>Now what's the third letter of dog? We did the D and the O, so all that's left now is guh.</dd>

<dt>A.</dt>
<dd>G!</dd>

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>3 - 2 - 1 - Blast Off!!!</dd>


The lessons stuck. She loves writing things phonetically.

I've tried to do similar stuff with E. but he's still young. Until recently the only questions I could think of that he could answer were animal noises. He's making complete sentences now, so I'll have to revisit this the next time we're on the playground. He does know a few letters.

Writing is notable among the many things we take for granted. You've been using it all your life. You can barely take a shower without reading a shampoo bottle.

But you know there was a time when writing was uncommon among lay people even in developed nations, just <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/literacy/#historical-perspective">two hundred years ago</a>. And there was a time when it was unheard of. People existed for millenia without writing. We just don't know much about people who didn't write.

Imagine the difficulty in going to the grocery store when you can't write down what you need.

Imagine the difficulty in just planning what you need to do over the weekend. Maybe before writing people just had to be better at keeping these lists in their heads.

But much of discovery had to be simply impossible. You can't run a proper scientific test without first stating your expectations. It's way to easy to fool yourself into thinking you got what you expected if you don't write it down first.

You've probably already had a conversation today in which you and a friend disagreed about what had been said just five minutes before. Maybe you remember what was said but you don't remember who said it. <a href="http://www.pointofinquiry.org/editing_our_pasts_dr._julia_shaw_on_the_illusion_of_memory/">Memory is unreliable</a>.

Given this, it's strange that we take writing for granted. We forget to do it even when it makes the most sense of anything. How many times have you visited the doctor, told her of your concerns, and come home to find you'd forgotten one or two things? Why didn't you just write that stuff down?

So here you go, big statement: Humans aren't modern without writing. I don't think I'm going out on a limb here. Being modern involves doing your thinking the best way you can. And the best way you can think will involve writing something down. Not everything. It's easy to overwhelm yourself. But something.

Whatever it is you're doing, get it in writing.

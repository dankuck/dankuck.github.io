Make graph puzzles quickly and easily using Mystery Picture Graph.

A mystery picture graph is a set of coordinates that you can plot on graph paper like a connect-the-dots puzzle. You remember these from math class.

I built Mystery Picture Graph to meet a need for myself. There are lots of great exercises puzzles for sale on <a href="http://teacherspayteachers.com">teacherspayteachers.com</a>. My kid likes those ones, but I needed more. I needed to be able to find my own pictures and turn them into fun puzzles. So I built this!

Here's how it works:

## Open Mystery Picture Graph

## Open an image to trace

Let's use this image of a handsome fellow.

<img src="/mystery-picture-graph/screenshots/dankuck.jpeg" class="full screenshot" />

It doesn't matter that it is low resolution. We just want to trace it.

## Start clicking

Each click lays down a point. The points connect to make a line.

Use the "Start New Line" button when you don't want a point to connect to the last one.

Here's what it looks like when we toggle off "Show Image".

## Copy the coordinates

The coordinates you clicked are shown in the output at the bottom.

Just copy those coordinates and print them out! Your favorite math wiz will love it.

## Other features

* There's a slider for zooming in and out.
* The "Set Origin" button lets you choose the center of your graph.
* The "Fit Image" button lets you resize the image to fit how you want it to.
* The quick facts box shows how many points your math champion will have to plot.
* The quick facts box also shows the minimum and maximum X and Y values. Make sure these fit on the graph paper you'll use.
* You can edit the coordinates and see the graph change too.

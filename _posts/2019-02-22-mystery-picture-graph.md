Make graph puzzles quickly and easily using <a href="/myster-picture-graph">Mystery Picture Graph</a>.

A mystery picture graph is a set of coordinates that you can plot on graph paper like a connect-the-dots puzzle. You remember... from math class?

I built Mystery Picture Graph to meet a need for myself. There are lots of great exercises for sale on <a href="http://teacherspayteachers.com">teacherspayteachers.com</a>. My kid likes those ones, but I needed more. I needed to be able to find my own pictures and turn them into fun puzzles. So I built this!

Here's how it works:

## Open Mystery Picture Graph

<a href="/mystery-picture-graph">Mystery Picture Graph</a>

## Load an image to trace

Let's use this image of a handsome fellow.

<img src="/mystery-picture-graph/screenshots/dankuck.jpeg" class="half screenshot" />

It doesn't matter that it is low resolution. We just want to trace it. Click "Trace Image".

## Start clicking

Each click lays down a point. The points connect to make a line.

Use the "Start New Line" button when you don't want a point to connect to the last one.

Here's what it looks like when we toggle off "Show Image".

## Copy the coordinates

The coordinates you clicked are shown in the output at the bottom.

Just copy those coordinates and print them out! Your favorite math wiz will love it.

## Some tips

* Zoom using the slider.
* Use "Set Origin" to choose the center of your graph.
* Use "Fit Image" to resize the image.
* Keep your graph simple by limiting the number of points.
* Make text edits in the coordinates box and see the graph change too. This is a way to delete points or move them slightly.

Make graph puzzles quickly and easily using Mystery Picture Graph.

A mystery picture graph is a set of coordinates that you can plot on graph paper like a connect-the-dots puzzle. You remember these from math class.

I built Mystery Picture Graph to meet a need for myself. There are lots of great exercises puzzles for sale on <a href="http://teacherspayteachers.com">teacherspayteachers.com</a>. My kids like them, but I need to be able to give them any picture. So I built this!

Here's how it works:

## Open Mystery Picture Graph

<a href="/mystery-picture-graph">Mystery Picture Graph</a>

<img src="/mystery-picture-graph/screenshots/empty-graph.png" class="full screenshot" />

## Open an image to trace

Let's use this image of a handsome fellow.

<img src="/mystery-picture-graph/screenshots/dankuck.jpeg" class="full screenshot" />

It doesn't matter that it is low resolution. We just want to trace it.

<img src="/mystery-picture-graph/screenshots/handsome-fellow-1.png" class="full screenshot" />

## Start clicking

Each click lays down a point. The points connect to make a line.

Use the "Start New Line" button when you don't want a point to connect to the last one.

Here's what it looks like when we click the "Show Image" toggle.

<img src="/mystery-picture-graph/screenshots/handsome-fellow-3.png" class="full screenshot" />

## Copy the coordinates

The coordinates you clicked are shown in the output at the bottom.

Just copy those coordinates and print them out! Your favorite math wiz will love it.

Mystery Picture Graph makes graph puzzles quickly and easily.

I thought I could build Mystery Picture Graph to meet a need for myself. My kids like to solve these puzzles and I need to be able to give them any picture, not just the ones for sale on <a href="http://teacherspayteachers.com">teacherspayteachers.com</a> (great resources, though, check them out).

A mystery picture graph is a set of coordinates that you plot on graph paper like a connect-the-dots puzzle. You remember these from math class.

Here's how it works:

== Open Mystery Picture Graph

<a href="/mystery-picture-graph">Mystery Picture Graph</a>

<img src="/mystery-picture-graph/screenshots/empty-graph.png" />

== Open an image to trace

Let's use this image of a handsome fellow.

<img src="/mystery-picture-graph/screenshots/dankuck.jpeg" />

It doesn't matter that it is low resolution. We just want to trace it.

== Start clicking

Each click lays down a point. The points connect to make a line.

Use the "Start New Line" button when you don't want a point to connect to the last one.

Here's what it looks like when we click the "Show Image" toggle.

== Copy the coordinates

The coordinates you clicked are shown in the output at the bottom.

Just copy those coordinates and print them out!

I don't follow a religion. Hard as religion is to talk about, I think we all kind of understand what it means. So maybe you'll understand me when I say that the more something is a religion, the more likely it's not true.

But the questions that religions try to address are hard. How should we behave? What should I do now? Why are things so unfair? Which things can I eat?

If the questions don't seem very pressing, we're happy to answer them on our own and see what happens. But when things get difficult, we start to doubt ourselves. That's good. It's important to get these things right.

When that happens, people start looking for an adviser. Hard questions need expert assistance.

You do the same thing when you want to invest money. You can try it yourself if you don't have much riding on your choices. But when you need to get serious, you realize you're not up to the task.

So in both cases you go out shopping for an adviser, right? You want to make sure you get the best guy investing your money or believes exactly where they'll have the best results.

Well, no you probably just visit the guy your parents go to. But that guy knows that you have options, so he has a selling method to get you in. To get you to invest your money or beliefs with him. 

* He has have references from big names, like Harvard or God.
* He'll give you a list of promises, like stock market tips or eternal salvation.
* He'll lay out a plan that is best for you, like a 401(k) or a nunnery.

And in the end, you'll go with the first guy you come across because you've got other things to do.

I don't fault anyone for looking to an expert in both of these cases. And in both cases, you don't have much to really judge your choice on. "Harvard sounds nice." 

"Did you say Jesus spoke to you? I've heard of him."

I found this question <a href="https://www.quora.com/Is-consciousness-around-us-as-well-as-inside-us/answer/Daniel-Kuck-Alvarez">on Quora</a>.

Here's my answer:

I hope not. Can you imagine if my door knob was looking at me? Does it hurt when I open the door? Itâ€™s a pretty horrifying possibility.

Since I am occasionally unconscious, I think I have enough familiarity with that state of being to guess that most things in the surrounding environment are unconscious all the time. So I prefer to focus my anxiety on other horrifying possibilities and let this one rest.

I found this question <a href="https://www.quora.com/My-almost-7-year-old-daughter-is-a-voracious-reader-She-can-go-through-like-3-chapter-books-one-evening-Is-this-too-much-of-reading-at-this-age/">on Quora</a>.

Here's my answer:

There are just two things to be careful of:

1. That she is spending time on other things as well, including socialization with other children.
2. That you review the things she is reading so that you can guide her in growing up. If the books she’s reading have strong messages, make sure she gets many different perspectives.

Other than that, there’s no problem with reading a lot. She’ll have a lot of resources to draw on when attempting to navigate her life.

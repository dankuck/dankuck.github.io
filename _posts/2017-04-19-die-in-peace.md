I found this question <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-can-I-do-today-that-will-make-me-die-in-peace">on Quora</a>.

Here's my answer:

Make a recurring donation to <a href="http://www.againstmalaria.com/">Against Malaria</a> which saves lives every day by giving bed nets to people in malaria-affected regions.

Of all charities, it saves the most lives for each dollar you give according to <a href="http://www.givewell.org/">GiveWell</a>. That’s another way of saying it’s the least wasteful use of your charity and so you can’t possibly waste your life doing this.

                <h2>What?</h2>

                <p>This is a custom Google search engine limited to
                    websites that apply Bayesian rationality to
                    the subjects they discuss.</p>

                <h2>What do you mean "rationality"?</h2>

                <p>
                    <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/rationalist-movement">Bayesian rationality</a>
                    is about improving our thinking and
                    decision-making using the best evidence available.</p>

                <p>Rationalists are especially concerned with probability
                    around evidence and outcomes. A lot of effort has gone
                    into improving our decision making processes and a lot
                    of digital ink has been spilled in this pursuit.</p>

                <h2>Why have a search engine for these sites?</h2>

                <p>These are the sites that
                    <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1434027186885097/permalink/3080950365526096/">rationalists
                    have identified as high-quality</a>. That means the
                    subjects are well thought-out and the evidence provided is
                    frequently strong or else is clearly marked when not
                    strong.
                </p>

                <h2>Are other sites worthless?</h2>

                <p>We aim to make this a search engine with better than average
                    odds of finding rationalist writings on any given
                    subject.</p>

                <p>Whatever subject you study, you'll probably find yourself
                    back on Google trying to find the truth at some
                    point. But a good first step is to check what rationalists
                    have already found. Your second step could be anything.</p>

                <h2>I have a site to submit</h2>

                <p>Great! Add it to
                    <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1434027186885097/permalink/3080950365526096/">the Facebook poll</a>
                    or email it to dankuck at gmail.com.
                </p>

                <p>In the short term, we'll add sites based on Google's custom
                    search engine limits and votes in the poll. In the long
                    term we'll seek out a polling software more in line with
                    our needs.
